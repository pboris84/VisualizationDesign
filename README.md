The three visualizations I chose were bar chart, scatterplot and angle graph. I
believe these three graphs answer the questions posed by the rubric and by the
data itself. Which drug was the most effective? Which drug is effective against
what? And which drug had the lowest amount to effectiveness ratio. This is the 
information that a drug company or doctor would want to know in reference
to these new wonder drugs.

The bar chart is a great way to spot the effectiveness level of each drug without
having to scan through the data very heavily. Relying on the elemenatry visual tool
of length comparison against a standardized axis, you can quickly tell that there
is a differnece in hieght between the effective and ineffective drugs. Assuming the
axises are correctly distributed, you can quickly see which drugs are the most effective

The scatterplot reveals which drug is effective against what by plotting the drugs
and the diseases on either axises, and seeing where the clustering happens. You can
quickly tell which drugs are the most effective against each disease by scanning the
pot location or clustering of the drugs in reference to the diseases. 

The angle graph can give you a good idea of where the lowest amount to effectiveness ratio
is. You want to know that your drug is effective in smaller doses, this information
is especially valuable for drug manufacturers as they would like to be able to use
fewer raw materials to produce their drugs. The angle graph is perfect for this because
it shows difference between drugs by the steepness of the angle. Making it very clear
which drugs are good and which ones arent.
